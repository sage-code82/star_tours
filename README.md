# STAR TOURS version 1.0

### Version 1.0 completed on 20.01.24

A front page for a mock up company offering holidays around the Star Wars galaxy.

Initial version a basic build with a slider gallery at the bottom

None of the buttons or links currently go anywhere. This will be added on for Version 2

practice for building responsive website to be able to be viewed on all devices.

### Version 1.0 update 29.01.24

While trying to sort the Slide Gallery I decided it would look better without it, this then made the website non-responsive so I need to have another look through all the code to see what has stopped it doing this.

## Version 1.1 to do list

- Hero Image to be an auto gallery
- Look into the Slide Gallery at the bottom to try and adjust the size of the images, perhaps make the section similar to room and plan section.
- Look into the CSS and spacing of the text on the hero image

* framer motion animations added to each section
* maybe change the sections around once the slide gallery is adjusted
